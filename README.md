From given accounts and tickets data, identify the applied method and compute the corresponding additional load.

Just place the "solution.py" in the directory where "accounts_v2.csv" and "tickets_v2.csv" are located.

You can also place it anywhere but provide the paths of above files as commandline arguments.

Usage:
python solution.py <accounts_filename_including_path> <tickets_filename_including_path>

Example:
python solution.py ./accounts_v2.csv ./tickets_v2.csv
(or)
python solution.py ./accounts_v2.csv ./tickets_v2.csv > /tmp/results.log
